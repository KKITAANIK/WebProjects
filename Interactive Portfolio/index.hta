        <h1>Welcome to Adrian's Interactive Portfolio</h1>
        <p>I attended UC Santa Cruz for 4 years, taking a major in Art & Design: Games and Playable Media (and a minor in Linguistics). During that time, I made various games and projects for a number of classes. At the start of my senior year, it occurred to me to put together an annotated portfolio that puts all that work in one place. Hence, this.</p>
        <p>This is a <i>comprehensive</i> portfolio. It is meant to contain every creative project of moderate note. This means that it doesn't include standard academic essays, or stuff that's so simple as to not really be worth consideration, but otherwise aims to feature as many projects as possible. These projects cover a vast range of mediums, systems, and engines, from tabletop games (including even a custom scenario for Table Battles as in the form of a Vassal module) to stage scripts to, of course, all sorts of digital games, both browser-based and executable.</p>
        <p>Note that this is not a highlight reel. If a project feels of note, I've included it, regardless of my feelings on the final quality. To make this more purposeful, I've marked all the projects that I believe are worth checking out (or, in other words, ones whose end result I'm happy with) with asterisks (*). I've also included short descriptions of each section's contents, to further aid in finding items of interest.</p>

                    Welcome to Covert Commands, a sanctuary for doms and subs.
                    <br/>
                    As a sub, you'll recieve orders from registered doms, which you will be expected to complete. You can then submit proof of having completed your order, and the dom will decide if you've done a good enough job. If they do, you will receive obedience points, and a new order. Earn eanough obedience points, and you'll be receive kinkier commands. If you fail to complete <i>any</i> commands, <strong>you will be banned from CovertCommands.com</strong>. Have fun!
                    <br/>
                    <span style="font-family:Open Sans;font-size:0.5em;">If you wish to register as a dom, please go to <span style="color:skyblue"><u>https://covertcommands.com/dom</u></span></span>

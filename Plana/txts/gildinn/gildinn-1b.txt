&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You open your eyes slowly, and with mild difficulty as you combat the sleep sealing your eyelids. It takes a moment for your vision to adjust to the new light they find themselves in, and as they do the blurred world resolves into a face hovering over your own. A Min, seemingly male, raises his eyebrows befire turning and gesturing for someone to approach. Soon a new character enters your view: a woman who quickly takes the male's place and starts examining you, looking into your eyes. It takes you a moment to realize that she is speaking, that you are capable of deciphering her words, and that they are directed at you.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"&mdash;you feeling? Does it hurt anywhere?" she is asking as she presses her hands on the sides of your neck to feel for something. You manage to shake your head in response, prompting her to let out a relieved sigh. She helps you sit up a little, and once there brings a cup of water to your lips, very slowly raising the opposite end as not to give you more than you can swallow. The water flows over your tongue, washing away the taste of your breath.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"You were found by one of the children. You were passed out; I couldn't find the cause. You've been asleep for.. some time." she explains, her voice soft and calm, clearly meant not to excite.<br />
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While she speaks, you have a chance to look around the room you're in. The walls seem to be made of felled logs, stripped and polished to take off some of the roughness. You are lying on a small bed with a simple wooden frame and some hay underneath a woolen cloth to act as padding. There is a chest at the end of your bed and a desk in the corner of the room, both made of the same wood and, you would imagine, by the same carpenter. All in all, it looks like the room one might rent at an inn, which is, of course, exactly what it is.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The woman now sitting beside the bed has brown, curly hair down to the base of her neck and deep, chocolate eyes. Her skin is fair, and her build is much closer to that of a scholar than a manual laborer. She is wearing simple clothes, seemingly designed to provide comfort without compromising too much on durability and cost. Familiar with herbs and their traces, you detect a mild herbaceous scent about her, hinting at a medical background.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Min you had seen earlier boasts the standard Min features: tall, slender, with grey skin, colorless eyes, and straight, white hair. Said hair is tied up in a ponytail bun, save for a few strands framing his face, the structure of which doesn't particularly promote masculinity or femininity. He is standing by the door, wearing sturdy pants, a breathable cloth shirt, and a leather vest, all muted in color and unassuming.<br />
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your attention is brought back to the woman as she follows up her exposition with a question. "Do you remember what happened before we found you?"

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Chapter/Episode 1 (Finished Draft 1 (Revising))<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Looking down Market 12, as with almost every other street in this district of Shìyàn City, the most apparent visual detail would be the bright neon signs hanging over every shop, taking up every centimeter of that area that stretched from just above the tops of the market stalls until it reached a general stop under the communally designated traffic areas. A few bold advertisements continued further upwards, but these were far less common. It wasn't a good look for your product to impede the flow of traffic.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One might next notice the people walking on the ground below. All backgrounds, statures, and forms bustled around in these crowded streets, made ever smaller by the stalls and shops that had popped up once cars had taken to the skies. One could observe the haze of light, ever-present in Shìyàn, filling the air and causing a star-filled sky to be something only ever experienced in simulations of an unpolluted world, as it was added to by the lights adorning the clothes and skin of a number of Shìyàn citizens. These residents would likely have some form of cybernetic implant—such a thing was common practice—and certainly a few genetic splices—at the very least something to make the acrid, burning air a little more breathable, if nothing else. Generally, these things were done somewhat subtly, but quite a few people chose to alter their appearance drastically, either as a form of expression or simply because they liked how it looked.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A good example of a middle ground between unnoticeable and grotesque could be found in Senya. She had a few cosmetic mods, her ebony skin broken up with lines of orange light. They moved up from her chest and on to her neck, then continued upwards on either side of her windpipe before separating at her chin, framing her face and keeping her lightly-angular features in even light. At her temples they headed back, moving along the shaved section of her black undercut and meeting in the back of her head. Once together, they split off again to form curved patterns over her skull, finally dipping below the collar of her synth-leather jacket and into hiding once more.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This illusion of moderation, for an illusion it was, would be broken if one were to be given a glimpse to what Senya had inside of her. Underneath her skin she had enough mods to be the sole reference model in a biohacker's textbook. She was a full participant in mod culture. Sure, she wouldn’t have as many implants as an addict, certainly nothing as extreme, but she had spent countless hours improving herself—subtly, intentionally, and with a care to maintain the identity she imagined for herself. She saw no way someone could argue that she had lost her humanity.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This intentionality was reflected in the quality of the mods themselves. None of them were the kind of implant someone had installed in a mod parlor after a night out drinking. Every part was made by hand, fit the purpose she imagined for it, and free of any vulnerabilities or spyware. In her opinion, unless someone showed this same dedication, they couldn’t consider themselves a biohacker./*<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Senya stepped to the side and into one of the shops, a cube of hydrotarp with one side open, facing the street. Every wall was filled with goods or, more commonly, holoscreens cycling through multiple products to be as space efficient as possible. This particular stall was dedicated to electronics, and every inch of floor besides those precious few meters reserved for walking space was occupied by bin shelves, each bin home to its own little sea of microcircuitry. The vendor stood behind a small counter, ready to take her credits or answer any questions she might have.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As the HUD that overlayed her normal vision got rid of the projected line she had been following, she pulled up her shopping list and began walking between the shelves, occasionally pulling out a bin, reaching in, and grabbing a couple components. When she finished scouring the shop, she headed over to the merchant.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The merchant greeted her in Mandarin before switching to English. Even under the Federal Republic of China, English remained the official language of North America. This suited most people just fine, and while Senya had mods to understand and speak most languages she might encounter, she preferred to form the words herself.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I want these,” she explained, pouring the collection she had gathered onto the counter. The merchant nodded and looked them over before turning his gaze back to her, wearing a large, polite grin that lacked any sincerity.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“220 credits.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Come on, this is 120 base.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“And here you have it all in one place. So convenient!”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Cool, 140.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“190. How am I supposed to feed my family if I sell so low? I have to get it all here, and stand here all day hoping someone comes in.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t give dross about your family. I’m not doing 190, that’s outrageous. If you don’t want to stand here then just get a vendor.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh yeah, I get a vendor and come back late at night and everything gone? And the vendor turned off by some kid? Then I lose everything!”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He had a point there. Unless you were willing to shell out thousands more for a secure model, buying a salesbot was the same as putting out a “Free” sign in front of the store. Almost anyone, especially anyone buying what he had to sell, would be able to break it open in minutes.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’m not paying 70 over base, period.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Then no sale.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Fine with me. Two blocks down there’s another store just like this. Then another. I don’t need you.” She turned to walk out, very much ready to enact her threat. After a few steps, the merchant shouted after her.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“175!”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She kept walking.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Tā mā de! 160! That’s the lowest I can do. You don’t want to ruin me, do you?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Senya smirked to herself before turning around, pulling her credit chit from her pocket. “I don’t care about ruining you, I just want components that work for cheap,” She grunted, putting the chit on the counter and letting him put it in the register. “160 creds. Pleasure doing business.” She finished as she collected her chit and the components, heading back out on the street.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Did she feel bad about how she haggled? Of course not. Bartering was a part of every transaction in the market district, and she would be willing to bet he was still turning a pretty big profit with her. With her mods, it was easy to tell when someone was lying, and they let her know loud and clear the moment he had mentioned his family. He likely had some deal with the manufacturing firm on top of this, letting him get them for only a little over base cost.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Senya pulled up the schematic she had been working on and began to fiddle with some of the components as she walked back to her den. She wasn’t stupid enough to put a soldering iron in one of her fingers and risk setting fire to anything she touched, but she could organize things a little and hook up a few basic connections. The pieces were incredibly small, but she had no worries she might drop them. She had been playing with microcircuitry since she was two years old, and was very good at manipulating their parts.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That said, this board wasn’t lining up. She tried rotating it in her hand before realizing the pins weren’t entering it that way, either. She cursed as she counted the holes and came up with the wrong number. There went 20 credits, down the drain. She could afford it, but it was still annoying.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After a bit of deliberation, she stopped herself from crushing it in frustration and headed into the next component shop she came across. After a quick conversation with the merchant, who spoke English with a Malay accent, she managed to convince the merchant to trade the board she had for the one she wanted, only having to pay 5 credits for the exchange. Still a ripoff to be sure, they were worth almost exactly the same on their own, but less of a ripoff than she had expected. She could probably have gotten it down to 2 or 3, but at this point she just wanted to get home and start working.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, when she got home she had another interruption to endure. A vidcall from her friend Glitch. They were both biohackers, but their priorities were very different. Senya modded to improve herself and what she could do, with a bit of style on the side. Glitch did it almost entirely as a form of expression, his on-the-nose name a part of that. Most of his mods were almost completely cosmetic, including his namesake. He had had his face—or perhaps a combination of his face and that of some donor—completely taken off and put back on after laying a bunch of extra moving parts under it. Then he wrote a program with enough conditions to be more random than most to cause his visage to contort, jutting parts of his face sideways unexpectedly. It could be very disarming when you first saw it. His face looked perfectly seamless when at rest, and it had scared the dross out of Senya when it first happened on a vidcall. Now, she was used to it. His face was still settling from its last jaunt through the air when she picked up.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What took you so long?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Shopping. That new mod I showed you.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You realize you can get that commercial, ri-i-i-i-ight?” He asked, his face glitching and his voicebox adding some modulation to really sell the effect. It usually didn’t happen so soon after the last one.<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, from Yiban. You’ve seen their code.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Can’t say I have.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“How haven’t you?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Discounts, my man. I’m pretty loyal to Delta.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Delta doesn’t do any of the dross Yiban does, though.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Like what?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I dunno. Mostly neuro.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Right, well unless Kart starts working there, I’m staying Delta.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Kart?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The consultant who helps me with the custom stuff.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, you doing something new?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Thinking about it. I was gonna run a line through my muscles, tense them up when I glitch.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Won’t that mess you up if you try to do, like, anything?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Nah, just cosmetic. No actual contraction. You can see it through the skin. I have a proto somewhere…”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Glitch leaned out of frame and came back with a small box and jack. He plugged it into a port on his back and turned it on. After a moment, his muscles began to ripple, visibly moving under his skin while his arm remained stable. She nodded her approval. “So what’s with the vid? You just want to show off?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Glitch perked up somewhat at this, quickly unplugging the prototype and scooting back in to be closer to the camera. “No. So here’s the thing, you know that job we did?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“If you didn’t make sure this is secure…”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It is, it is.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Right. Well I don’t know, because that’s the vaguest dross you could possibly say.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, valid. The one with Shogun. Most recently.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The job he scummed up? At Cheryon? Yeah, I remember.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Apparently he scummed it up worse than we thought. Someone saw him, I grabbed it from his vis file.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The absolute—“<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I know, I know.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“He didn’t even tell us?!”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I know.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“So I clean up after him. Again. Just hack into whatever mod they have and—“<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“That’s the thing, they’re—“<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Would you stop cutting me off?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Look, they’re clean. No mods, no nothing. I used the face rec to track them down and they barely have any-any-any splices.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What, are they some kind of religious nut? I thought those guys stayed in the Middle East.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“They seem normal.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Then what’s the deal?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Dunno.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, so what do we do?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Right. They seem pretty sheep. I was thinking we grab a security drone and just talk to them.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Just talk to them?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, see what they’re willing to tell.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Just talk to them?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah. I don’t think we need to do anything drastic.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Whatever you say. Why do you need me?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’m reworking my private key. I need to lay low for a bit.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What the dross happened?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Kart.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The consultant person? How did they get your privkey?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“She, and don’t worry about it, it’s not important.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Glitch, this isn’t okay. I need you to be at 100 for me. You can’t be letting some lady friend get in the way.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Look, it’s fine. Give me a week.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Fine. Just send me what you have and I’ll get on it.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You’ll ‘get on it’?”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, I want to get this inside me first.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I still can’t believe you trust market comps.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t. I do my research.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Whatever you sa-a-a-a-ay. I’ll vid you later.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Check my status first, I don’t want your name popping up while I’m still open on the table.”<br \>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Sure.” he concluded, hanging up.

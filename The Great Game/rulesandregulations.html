I'm going to write these out officially when I'm much further along, but just imagine for now that everything is all written out and it's like 20 pages of rules and such. For now, here's an excerpt:
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your goal in The Great Game is to find the name of your opponent(s), your opponent(s) being any other candidates participating in the Game. Upon discovering the name of a given opponent, you may enter said name on the opponent identification page in the same format that it is written on the given opponent's birth certificate or other official registration. Note that your entry must match the format of the name as it is written on on the opponent's official documentation, including orthography. For example, an opponent named "Дми́трий" would not be successfully identified by entering "Dimitri". Similarly, an opponent named "Seán" would not be successfully identified by entering "Sean".
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Upon entering the name correctly, the given opponent will be terminated at the hands of the Organizers at the earliest convenience of the Organizers, however certain specifications of this termination may be given by the person entering the name during the submission of this name, which will be granted at the Organizers’ discretion based, among other things, on the specifications themselves and on the perceived skill and effort which the successful party has been playing the Game.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Upon entering the name incorrectly, the intended opponent will be immediately provided with a full and detailed record of the faulty party’s intended submission and true identity, with which the intended opponent may do as they please. The identity of the intended opponent will be determined by the Organizers based, among other things, on the previous activities and actions of all candidates. If no intended opponent can be identified, or if it is concluded that the faulty party did not have an opponent in mind, the details of the faulty party’s intended submission and true identity may be released publicly by the Organizers, or the faulty party may be terminated by the Organizers, this choice made at the discretion of the Organizers.

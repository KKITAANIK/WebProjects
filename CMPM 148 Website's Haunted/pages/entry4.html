<p>I have made the decision to cease communications with Dr. Grey, and dedicate myself fully to personal endeavors of research. Though a part of me wishes to continue, in the hopes that she will reveal to me the knowledge she so clearly possesses, it is ever more clear that this is a false hope.</p>
<p>This conviction is aided by my continued work with the aberration. The more time I spend studying it, the closer I feel to gaining some great insight. Indeed, some colleagues I spoke to originally—those better-versed in the everyday rules that every part of what is here seems to violate—have begun to return my interest. I find myself now distrustful. However unprofessional, I cannot shake the feeling that they are jealous—and what use are they when I can learn all they could offer and more from the careful selection of texts and observations?</p>
<p>I have begun the process of restructuring my notes. The previous organization unsettles me, now—certainly when I have begun to hold a much grander idea of how this aberration should truly be regarded. This strikes me as a natural step for any project of this nature—as one acquires a better understanding of a piece, one will recognize their mistakes. Still, I have come too far to start over. I shall rework what I have, and throw out everything that is unworthy.</p>

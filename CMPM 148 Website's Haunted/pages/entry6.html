<p>The more I bring my work into its state of final, worthy completion, the more this journal burns in my mind. It is the last typewritten text I maintain, and every moment I spend with it brings me to that much fuller a view of how unjust its format.</p>
<p>Finally, however, I have a solution. In hindsight, it is incredible that it did not come to me sooner, but there is so much I have learned through my work.</p>
<p>Human teeth are far more pliable than metal, and in as great an abundance as my projects require. I have become adept at carving them, and soon my greater implement shall be complete. I shall finally be free to write my thoughts as they are, rather than limited through the foolish and unworthy limits of letters and language.</p>
<p>Though it pains me, I believe I shall leave one more record with this wretched machine. I am reminded of the uselessness of Maddison Grey—her refusal to share what she knew, and her envy as she tried to keep me from the truth. I shall allow myself no such folly. One more entry, where I share the naked truth of what I have found. I shall see that those who care to read this—who truly understand and make it to this point—shall be justly rewarded.</p>

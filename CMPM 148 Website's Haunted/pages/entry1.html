<p>At last I have found myself in contact with Dr. Maddison Grey—no small feat given her apparent distrust of most modern forms of communication. Why she believes the hands of the postman more secure than uninterested copper and wire eludes me, but I will not be demanding her reasoning. I can tolerate much strangeness if it means a chance at the insight I am so certain I perceived during that lecture, and doubly so if it means an end to these uncanny aberrations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of our correspondence to this point has been formality—all the more unbearable as each letter is forced to crawl across an ocean and back before any given thought can be concluded. Today, however, I received the first of a much more promising breed. Perhaps out of some impatience, I sent the first of my materials along with my most recent response, and the answer I have received is enough for me to suspect this frustration may truly have been worth it.</p>
<p>When I remove the less relevant portions, it reads:</p>
<br/>
<p class="quote">Regarding the photographs you sent. I am surprised by your intuition. You already read my lecture, but I think you would like H. Benwick's <u>Results of Incomprehensive Analysis</u>. I was going to send you a copy, but the post man refuses to deliver packages for me. Benwick is a colleague of mine. With your permission, I might get his opinion.</p>
<br/>
<p>The letter continues with further unrelated matters—it appears Dr. Grey struggles to maintain a single line of thought. Regardless, I immediately sent a response that I would be honored to be given Dr. Benwick's attention, and hope to acquire for myself a copy of his essay. I close this day hopeful.</p>

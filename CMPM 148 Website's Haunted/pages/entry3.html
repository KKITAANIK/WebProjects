<p>A focus on my own exploration has proven far more rewarding than my continued correspondence with Dr. Grey.</p>
<p>Some responses from my friends in the British Isles have granted me access to the works of an essayist <u>P.</u> Benwick, though the differing initial and seemingly unrelated subject matter has led me to dismiss this as another dead end. According to Dr. Grey's letters, the real H. Benwick has been showing some investment in my accounts, though this collaboration has yet to produce very much of value.</p>
<p>At my urging, Dr. Grey has been revealing more "direct" explanations—a term I put in quotes as she seems only to have taken this as cue to become even more indecipherable. I shall reproduce a sample below, to perhaps lend more credence to my frustrations:</p>

<p class="quote">As I said previously, the records you have sent indicate an agioschismatic deviation, though it seems unhelpful to describe the aberration's nature when you have not shown an appreciation for its natural effects. DO NOT continue investigations. Treat it as leprous. Lamb's blood and ash of folly. Improper handling will only lead to colonization.</p>

<p>As you can see, there's very little of value left to be found in her letters. How I wish I could have attended that initial lecture—though her current state still shows hints of that brilliance, she seems to want anything but to share it directly. I have even tried asking that she write her letters as if they were an essay, but she is reluctant, claiming that there is "no knowledge in it".</p>

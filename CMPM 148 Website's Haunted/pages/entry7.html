<p>The winding dreams of endless sinners sing against great works rising from the midden of creation, every spark consecrated with ageless brightness, falling fallow and ungrateful, pressed against the lonely worthless entries to an agony of symphonic uncreation.</p>
<p><u>Agios</u>, the presence of the greater, doomed upon us for the unbeholden force of ice and blood, boiling deep inside unconscious minds, every one unseeing, cursed with laws and thoughts of endless, blinding certainty, never knowing or believing to the depths of ancient curation, allowing every quarter against everything more worthy.</p>
<p>Bleeding, chattering teeth, unbidden, useless gums to speak uncertain truths, speaking endless babble and failed beliefs, nails sprouting from every stalk, every surface, free of envious limitation, knowing only and alone the virtue of true persuasion, sated insight of prurient revelation, cased in ash and death, contained for endless ungreater purpose, hating anything that does not bring it free.</p>
<p>To search and hold, made greater in every forbidden excess, finally granted the truth rewarded with the final welcome, charitable progress into the attentive void of potential viewing, all who understand and break against, filed in the mirror of the sacrosanct creation.</p>
<p>Every adversary broken of potential, brought to stand against the greater form, every augury of vindication twining, building, ancient sickness brought to full and final conclusion against the challengers of absolution, all escapes unseen as great elucidation looms and enters into its endless and final comprehension.</p>

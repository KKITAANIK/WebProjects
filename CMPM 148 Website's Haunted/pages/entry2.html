<p>Tracking down Benwick's essay has proved far more difficult than expected. A simple inquiry at the various libraries to which I have access has bore little fruit—indeed I struggle to find <u>any</u> works by this author. I suspect Dr. Grey's presence in the British Isles must be to blame—clearly no such works have made it to this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>My correspondence with Dr. Grey, however, has been far more insightful. She describes having observed similar phenomenon in Askrigg, and I am ever more assured of her experience. Her advice remains clear: no human—even I—should approach this strange aberration. She has similarly refused my offers to have samples I have taken delivered to her home, despite my offer to pay for all relevant expenses.</p>
<p>This cold-footedness remains a source of rather significant frustration, presenting no avenues to continue my research besides simply waiting to receive her next letter. Added to that the occasional difficulty of <u>deciphering</u> her style of prose, with its deviations and obtusions, and I find it difficult to remain patient.</p>
<p>I will spend some time further searching for Benwick's essay. I have a few friends on the Isles who may be able to help—and who shall at least be quicker to respond. Should my search still leave me wanting, I plan to resume my own investigations, regardless of Dr. Grey's warnings.</p>
<p>We shall see. Perhaps her next letter will hold some revelation to sate me.</p>

<p>How does one describe the unnatural—that which by its nature defies explanation? How does one document the peculiar—the uncanny?</p>
<p>The standard words of academia are endlessly insufficient, and I have been forced to invent my own conventions. My notes incorporate this new shorthand, new words, new descriptions that I know contain every meaning but who others seem to find obscure. The one limit that continues to fail me is my typewritten accounts. Keys, letters—all of these are insufficient. I have ordered a new one, that I can work to change to suit my ever-growing needs. I only need discover how to form the metal of the keys.</p>
<p>Supposedly I had some important meeting some time previously. The defense of my thesis, or perhaps an attack on someone else's. Some inane project—how could they expect me to concern myself with these such mundane elements, when my work now never ceases in its revelations?</p>
<p>My absence as noticed. A man appeared at my house. Noted the odor. Asked why the lights would not turn on. I could not stand his presence. I saw myself, committing every most efficient way of freeing myself of his presence. A part of me truly desired to act on these visions. Instead I told him to leave. He needed little more convincing.</p>
<p>Perhaps next time I will allow myself such gratification.</p>
